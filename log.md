# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### (First Run) Day 1: Mon August 20, 2018 - Day 20: Sept Sun 23, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked through FreeCodeCamp: Introduction to Basic HTML and HTML5, Set Up Repo On Github

**Thoughts:** Though it's been a while I have a fair understanding of HTML so breezing thru the HTML section was pretty easy, but a great refresher. I'm having more issues setting up and learning how to use Github and repositories. It's a completely new platform for me, learning a whole new set of terms and functions, has been a bit overwhelming lol.

<!-- **Link to work:** None Today -->
### (Second Run) Day 1: Sun Sept 30, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Completed Lois Mailou Jones Tribute Page on CodePen

**Thoughts:** Decided to restart my 100days. I completed the Responsive Tribute Page challenge on FreeCodeCamp. Though I feel like it took way longer than it probably should have. I played with alot of CSS elements and learned alot.

### Day 2: Mon Oct 1, 2018

**Today's Progress**: FCC Survey Form

**Thoughts** Started working on the survey form using Html, Css & Bootstrap. Curious on how I can get sumbitted responses 
from this survey. 


### Day 3: Tues Oct 2, 2018

**Today's Progress**: FCC Survey Form Day 2

**Thoughts** Still building form, Im starting to memorize more code as I build. Working on styling. I wanted to collect real data with this survey but that may be more complicated than I thought at this point in my journey.

### Day 4: Wed Oct 3, 2018

**Today's Progress**: FCC JavaScript

**Thoughts**: Java is not making sense to me at this point. Reading and writing math backwards lol...It's different than I thought. But I'm going to keep going, and hopefully it will get better easier to comprehend. 

### Day 5: Thurs Oct 4, 2018

**Today's Progress**: FCC JavaScript: Add, Multiply, Subtract and Divide

**Thoughts**: The big bad java monster was a lot less scary today lol . I think Im starting to understand.

### Day 6: Fri Oct 5, 2018

**Today's Progress**: FCC Basic JavaScript: Assignments with Augumented Components, Concatenating Strings 

**Thoughts**: 2.5 hours of code today. Im feeling far more comfortable with java moving through these lessons. Just really takes some concentration and thinking outside of the norm. 

### Day 7: Sat Oct 6, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Java & More Java, Completed Survey Page

**Thoughts**: Worked Thru more Java lessons on FCC. Finished Survey Page. Although the survey page passed I still need to work out a few things. I'll probably go back and revamp as I learn more.

### Day 8: Sun Oct 7, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Back to Bootstrap

**Thoughts**: Didnt finish all of the Bootstrap exercises in FCC. Went back & worked on a few of them. 

### Day 9: Mon Oct 8, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished Bootstrap, on to JQuery

**Thoughts**: Not sure why Javascript basics is before front end libraries on FCC. Put a pause on Java to finsih all front end libraries. Finshed Bootstrap, onto JQuery! 


### Day 10: Tues Oct 9, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished JQuery

**Thoughts**: I really enjoyed JQuery! The lessons were fairly short on freecodecamp so I am assuming that Jquery is not often used? Im not sure, either way the lessons were fun. Looking forward to SASS!

### Day 11: Wed Oct 10, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Information & some SASS

**Thoughts**: Not much coding today. Signed up with TheOdinProject to get a better understanding of Github. I also think I'll start with curriculums on there because its a bit more infomative than FreeCodeCamp. I did tho, take some time today and work thru a few lessons on SASS in FCC. 

### Day 12: Thurs Oct 11, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Product Page

**Thoughts**: Started working on Product Page in CodePen

### Day 13: Fri Oct 12, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Product Page 

**Thoughts**: Referenced alot from W3schools. Playing with different lines of code. Felt like I wasted a lot of time but I learned a few things.  


### Day 14: Sat Oct 13, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Product Page 

**Thoughts**: Cleared code a few times. I think I tried to rush the process instead of planning out the page. Stepping back to be more intentional with the product page. 


### Day 15,16,17,18,19,20: Oct 14-20

**Today's Progress**: missed a day, and an hour a day thereafter...but not much to say.

**Thoughts**: So day by day I've coded for an hour trying to figure out how to properly align my nav bar amoungst other things. Im pretty fed up. I've used bootstrap, HTML & CSS. I think im hung up because I have an idea and I want to execute it how I see it in my head but even when I do find the script I believe will work...IT DOESN'T. I havent resorted to a forum to help...which I probably should have done that as soon as I started to have difficulty. I've gotten more frustrated and less motivated day by day. Hoping to start off next week on a better foot and get this done, for the sake of staying positive. 

### Day 21: Sun Oct 21, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Learning about the Terminal 

**Thoughts**: Via the Odin Project & Viking Code School learned how to use terminal, access man pages and navigate around directories.

### Day 22: Mon Oct 22, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Command Line 

**Thoughts**: More learning and playing with the Command Line, scary...the fear of potentially destroying my computer. lol...Like do I trust myself that much? Still cool stuff...im very intrigued. I feel like a baby hacker...soom i'll join Annoymous...(kidding kidding) 

### Day 23: Tue Oct 23, 2018

**Today's Progress**: The Forbidden One : Dreamweaver

**Thoughts**: Today I decided to blow the dust off of Dreamweaver & give it a go. Why? I really don't know. I noticed it has not made one mention in any of the articles I've read about learning to code. I was curious & this is what I've found. Dream weaver makes things hella easy....and hard all at the same time. I opened up a Bootstrap template and noticed a string of stylesheets attached. Css, Java, Python and a few more. Since im not fully informed of how all of these work. I wasnt sure if they were necessary...but hey what do I know? The template also had a note to not change the font....THE FONT? ( scratches head ) I thought templates were meant to be changed? Honestly the template looked simple. No animation. Nothing fancy...I started to add and remove things to see how things work/shift. In the end I think I need to learn a bit more to really judge dreamweaver. Ol faithful seem to have alot going on. Which I have no clue if its a good or bad thing.
