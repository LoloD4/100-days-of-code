# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: August 20, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Worked through FreeCodeCamp: Introduction to Basic HTML and HTML5, Set Up Repo On Github

**Thoughts:** Though it's been a while I have a fair understanding of HTML so breezing thru the HTML section was pretty easy, but a great refresher. I'm having more issues setting up and learning how to use Github and repositories. It's a completely new platform for me, learning a whole new set of terms and functions, has been a bit overwhelming lol. Also, Github flagged me...I'm not sure why, but I assume it's because of my name. Which...happens often.
