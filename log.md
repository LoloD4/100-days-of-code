# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### (First Run) Day 1: Mon August 20, 2018 - Day 20: Sept Sun 23, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked through FreeCodeCamp: Introduction to Basic HTML and HTML5, Set Up Repo On Github

**Thoughts:** Though it's been a while I have a fair understanding of HTML so breezing thru the HTML section was pretty easy, but a great refresher. I'm having more issues setting up and learning how to use Github and repositories. It's a completely new platform for me, learning a whole new set of terms and functions, has been a bit overwhelming lol.

### (Second Run) Day 1: Sun Sept 30, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Completed Lois Mailou Jones Tribute Page on CodePen

**Thoughts:** Decided to restart my 100days. I completed the Responsive Tribute Page challenge on FreeCodeCamp. Though I feel like it took way longer than it probably should have. I played with alot of CSS elements and learned alot.

### Day 2: Mon Oct 1, 2018

**Today's Progress**: FCC Survey Form

**Thoughts** Started working on the survey form using Html, Css & Bootstrap. Curious on how I can get sumbitted responses 
from this survey. 


### Day 3: Tues Oct 2, 2018

**Today's Progress**: FCC Survey Form Day 2

**Thoughts** Still building form, Im starting to memorize more code as I build. Working on styling. I wanted to collect real data with this survey but that may be more complicated than I thought at this point in my journey.

### Day 4: Wed Oct 3, 2018

**Today's Progress**: FCC JavaScript

**Thoughts**: Java is not making sense to me at this point. Reading and writing math backwards lol...It's different than I thought. But I'm going to keep going, and hopefully it will get better easier to comprehend. 

### Day 5: Thurs Oct 4, 2018

**Today's Progress**: FCC JavaScript: Add, Multiply, Subtract and Divide

**Thoughts**: The big bad java monster was a lot less scary today lol . I think Im starting to understand.

### Day 6: Fri Oct 5, 2018

**Today's Progress**: FCC Basic JavaScript: Assignments with Augumented Components, Concatenating Strings 

**Thoughts**: 2.5 hours of code today. Im feeling far more comfortable with java moving through these lessons. Just really takes some concentration and thinking outside of the norm. 

### Day 7: Sat Oct 6, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Java & More Java, Completed Survey Page

**Thoughts**: Worked Thru more Java lessons on FCC. Finished Survey Page. Although the survey page passed I still need to work out a few things. I'll probably go back and revamp as I learn more.
