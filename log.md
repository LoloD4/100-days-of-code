# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Mon August 20, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Worked through FreeCodeCamp: Introduction to Basic HTML and HTML5, Set Up Repo On Github

**Thoughts:** Though it's been a while I have a fair understanding of HTML so breezing thru the HTML section was pretty easy, but a great refresher. I'm having more issues setting up and learning how to use Github and repositories. It's a completely new platform for me, learning a whole new set of terms and functions, has been a bit overwhelming lol. Also, Github flagged me...I'm not sure why, but I assume it's because of my name. Which...happens often. 

<!-- **Link to work:** None Today -->

### Day 2: Tues August 21, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked halfway through FreeCodeCamp: Basic CSS

**Thoughts:** Re-learned and learned some styling in CSS. I am happy I decided to revist the front-end fundamentals. I look forward to getting into Javascript and working on a project, tho. However, so far so good. Can't wait to get out the basics.

### Day 3: Wed August 22, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Completed Basic CSS

**Thoughts:** I learned more about CSS from FCC than I did from Intro to Web Design in college. Nevertheless, the curriculum is starting to get more challenging which is great.  


### Day 4: Thurs August 23, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Intro to Visual Design

**Thoughts:** Simple stuff so far. Im sure it will become more challenging as I move along. 


### Day 5: Fri August 24, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Positioning Elements, Anchor Tags, & Css Offsets

**Thoughts:** So today was enlightening. I only did about 12 lessons on FreeCodeCamp but I got a better understanding of Positioning Elements, Anchor Tags & ect in Visual Design. I've always manipulated these elements before, but never really knew at the core what their function was & how it really worked. I kinda always just played round and interchanged options until something functioned in a somewhat desireable manner! lol...Feels good to have a real understanding. 


### Day 6: Sat August 25, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Applied Visual Design, CSS Linear Gradients, Create Texture and Patterns with CSS



### Day 7: Sun August 26, 2018

**Today's Progress**: CSS Animation, Keyframes & the Bezier Curve

**Thoughts:** Okay, I've finally gotten to the fun stuff! With FreeCodeCamps code I completed the script to loop a heart using Infinite animation. The animation reminded me of various ios apps, which was pretty cool. Keyframes challenaged me a bit. It's quite a lot to remember, but then there is always Google. Learned what the Bezier Curve is. Three Bezier lessons left in Applied Visual Design. 


### Day 8: Mon August 27, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Bezier Curves (Cont), Applied Accessibility

**Thoughts:** Up to this point everything as been simple. Understanding Bezier Curves is a bit difficult. I tried to watch a Youtube video but im still not completely obsorbing the information. I definietly think I'll have to watch a few more or hopefully i'll learn more as I move along. Moved on to Applied Accessibility. 

### Day 9: Tue August 28, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked Midway through Applied Visual Design. 


### Day 10: Wed August 29, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished Applied Accessibility & Responsive Web Design Principles, on to CSS Flexbox. 

**Thoughts:** I feel like my thoughts on progress will be fairly short until I get to my first project on FreeCodeCamp. I will say the curriculum has gotten to be more challenging. The questions they ask us to solve seem to be in a trick format. Either we already know, we are highly intuitive or we have to search for the answer. Sooo...I've had to search for the answer to the last few sections. At first I felt like "oh crap, maybe im not cut out to do this". Im still a bit weary. Im not sure im retaining some of this information. I think I will find out the answer to my questions once I start on projects. 


### Day 11: Thur August 30, 2018

**Today's Progress**: CSS Flexbox 

**Thoughts:** Worked halfway through CSS Flexbox on CodeCamp. My progress seems to be dragging due to my energy levels. I look forward to getting proper sleep this extended weekend. Flexbox is straight foward, im getting it so far, not complicated and retaining information pretty well. 


### Day 12: Fri August 31, 2018

**Today's Progress**: CSS Grid 

**Thoughts:** Worked halfway through CSS Flexbox on CodeCamp. My progress seems to be dragging due to my energy levels. I look forward to getting proper sleep this extended weekend. Flexbox is straight foward, im getting it so far, not complicated and retaining information pretty well. 


### Day 13: Sat Sept 1, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished CSS Grid 


### Day 14: Sun Sept 2, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked on Portfolio Website.


### Day 15: Mon Sept 3, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Started building a Tribute Page 

### Day 16: Tues Sept 4, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Used CSS, switched to Bootstrap, learning fundamentals

**Thoughts:** Peeked at code examples and noticed a majority of people were using Bootstrap to make their pages responsive. So I paused on building my tribute page to learn bootstrap.

### Day 17: Wed Sept 5, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Bootstrap & More BootStrap

### Day 18: Sat Sept 8, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked thru a few Bootstrap exercises on FreeCodeCamp 

### Day 19: Sat Sept 15, 2018

**Today's Progress**: WebFlow, HTML & CSS on Codepen

**Thoughts:** It's been a week since I've coded or studied code. I heard about Webflow and took a few hrs to study the program...but no code invloved. Started a HTML & CSS cheatsheet on Codepen. Coding from memory to see how much information I've retained....so far, its not looking like much. I feel my coding journey is going to take 200days to to even scratch the surface, but im not in a rush.
