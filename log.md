# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Mon August 20, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Worked through FreeCodeCamp: Introduction to Basic HTML and HTML5, Set Up Repo On Github

**Thoughts:** Though it's been a while I have a fair understanding of HTML so breezing thru the HTML section was pretty easy, but a great refresher. I'm having more issues setting up and learning how to use Github and repositories. It's a completely new platform for me, learning a whole new set of terms and functions, has been a bit overwhelming lol. Also, Github flagged me...I'm not sure why, but I assume it's because of my name. Which...happens often.

### Day 2: Tues August 21, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked halfway through FreeCodeCamp: Basic CSS

**Thoughts:** Re-learned and learned some styling in CSS. I am happy I decided to revist the front-end fundamentals. I look forward to getting into Javascript and working on a project, tho. However, so far so good. Can't wait to get out the basics.

### Day 3: Wend August 22, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Completed Basic CSS

**Thoughts:** I learned more about CSS from FCC than I did from Intro to Web Design in college. Nevertheless, the curriculum is starting to get more challenging which is great.
