# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Mon August 20, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Worked through FreeCodeCamp: Introduction to Basic HTML and HTML5, Set Up Repo On Github

**Thoughts:** Though it's been a while I have a fair understanding of HTML so breezing thru the HTML section was pretty easy, but a great refresher. I'm having more issues setting up and learning how to use Github and repositories. It's a completely new platform for me, learning a whole new set of terms and functions, has been a bit overwhelming lol. Also, Github flagged me...I'm not sure why, but I assume it's because of my name. Which...happens often.

### Day 2: Tues August 21, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked halfway through FreeCodeCamp: Basic CSS

**Thoughts:** Re-learned and learned some styling in CSS. I am happy I decided to revist the front-end fundamentals. I look forward to getting into Javascript and working on a project, tho. However, so far so good. Can't wait to get out the basics.

### Day 3: Wed August 22, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Completed Basic CSS

**Thoughts:** I learned more about CSS from FCC than I did from Intro to Web Design in college. Nevertheless, the curriculum is starting to get more challenging which is great.  


### Day 4: Thurs August 23, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Intro to Visual Design

**Thoughts:** Simple stuff so far. Im sure it will become more challenging as I move along. 


### Day 5: Fri August 24, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Positioning Elements, Anchor Tags, & Css Offsets

**Thoughts:** So today was enlightening. I only did about 12 lessons on FreeCodeCamp but I got a better understanding of Positioning Elements, Anchor Tags & ect in Visual Design. I've always manipulated these elements before, but never really knew at the core what their function was & how it really worked. I kinda always just played round and interchanged options until something functioned in a somewhat desireable manner! lol...Feels good to have a real understanding. 


### Day 6: Sat August 25, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Applied Visual Design, CSS Linear Gradients, Create Texture and Patterns with CSS



### Day 7: Sun August 26, 2018

**Today's Progress**: CSS Animation, Keyframes & the Bezier Curve

**Thoughts:** Okay, I've finally gotten to the fun stuff! With FreeCodeCamps code I completed the script to loop a heart using Infinite animation. The animation reminded me of various ios apps, which was pretty cool. Keyframes challenaged me a bit. It's quite a lot to remember, but then there is always Google. Learned what the Bezier Curve is. Three Bezier lessons left in Applied Visual Design. 


### Day 8: Sun August 26, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Bezier Curves (Cont), Applied Accessibility

**Thoughts:** Up to this point everything as been simple. Understanding Bezier Curves is a bit difficult. I tried to watch a Youtube video but im still not completely obsorbing the information. I definietly think I'll have to watch a few more or hopefully i'll learn more as I move along. Moved on to Applied Accessibility.
