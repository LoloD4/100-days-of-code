# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### (First Run) Day 1: Mon August 20, 2018 - Day 20: Sept Sun 23, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked through FreeCodeCamp: Introduction to Basic HTML and HTML5, Set Up Repo On Github

**Thoughts:** Though it's been a while I have a fair understanding of HTML so breezing thru the HTML section was pretty easy, but a great refresher. I'm having more issues setting up and learning how to use Github and repositories. It's a completely new platform for me, learning a whole new set of terms and functions, has been a bit overwhelming lol.

### (Second Run) Day 1: Sun Sept 30, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Completed Lois Mailou Jones Tribute Page on CodePen

**Thoughts:** Decided to restart my 100days. I completed the Responsive Tribute Page challenge on FreeCodeCamp. Though I feel like it took way longer than it probably should have. I played with alot of CSS elements and learned alot.

** Thoughts** Still building form, Im starting to memorize more code as I build. Working on styling. I wanted to collect real data with this survey but that may be more complicated than I thought at this point in my journey.
